I have chosen a MSP430FR2355 microcontroller.
It is in the LQFP48 package.

Regarding the two buttons S1 and S2:
	When pressed these bring the micrcontroller pin down to LOW.
	Must enable internal pullup resistors aswell. No external pull
	resistors on board. Don't use pulldown, since then pressing
	the button will not cause a change in pin state.

There are 6 GPIO ports
	P1 P2 P3 ... P6
	PA PB PC are the exact same physical pins just refered to with
	16bit instructions. For eg: P1 is the low byte of PA. P2 is the high
	byte of PA. P3 is low byte of PB.... etc.

When building a project you have two options:
	compile for debugging. By default makes uC stop at a break point
	just before first line of main. Waits here for further instruction
	from debugger.
	Compile for release. Doesn't wait for anything, meant for final use.
Notice that even if you build for release, the debug probe will stop supplying
power to the uC as soon as it makes a USB port connection to your computer.
Solve this by only pluggin the USB connector in slightly. This way power is
supplied to everything, not no connection is made, so the debug probe doesn't
cut power to the uC.
